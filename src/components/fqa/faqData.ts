        question: "Is my API key visible to anyone?",

    },
    {
        question: "Are prompts stored on the server?",

        question: "Do you log any kind of usage data?",
        answer: "We maintain minimal logging for system performance and security purposes only. We do not log your prompts, generated images, or any creative content."
    },
    {
        question: "Do you save generated images?",
        answer: "No, we do not save any generated images. All images are delivered directly to you and immediately removed from our servers' memory."

        question: "Can I use the platform without an account?",
        answer: "No, you need to create an account to use OSIG. This ensures secure API key management and provides you with a personalized experience."
    },
    {
        question: "Is there a generation limit?",
        answer: "Generation limits depend on your OpenRouter API key quota. We implement rate limiting (10 requests per hour) to prevent abuse, but your overall usage is determined by your own API key limits."
